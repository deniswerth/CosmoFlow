# The Cosmological Flow

* Paragraph of intro presenting the repository

* Link to arxiv paper.

## Getting Started

## Example Notebook

## Examples of Inflationary Correlators

* sentence saying that we provide several examples of inflationary correlators, look at the paper)
* Give a few examples of plots + minimal explanation

## Extensions and Future Work

We have turned the Cosmological Flow approach into an open-source tool available for cosmologists. This tool is clearly just a first building-block of a far-reaching program of exploring the rich physics of inflation. A complete 


This would require several improvements. First, such tool should be easy to install and use, and easily scriptable. In particular, performing the Legendre transform to derive the Hamiltonian given a Lagrangian should be performed in an automatic manner. Second, we ideally want this tool to be fast, producing instantaneous results. Such improvement calls for a better and more sophisticated numerical implementation that the one that was used so far. More ambitiously, we could include the transport approach routine in the already-existing chain of late-time cosmological tools. This would automate the generation of theoretical primordial data that can be directly used for CMB or LSS observables. \DW{Rephrase this paragraph in a positive way and that we already have a code, and put it before the outlooks.
