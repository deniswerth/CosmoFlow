# The Cosmological Collider Flow

This folder contains details on the time evolution of the Cosmological Collider signals. We are interested in the three-point correlation function of the curvature perturbation $\langle \zeta_{\vec{k}_1} \zeta_{\vec{k}_2} \zeta_{\vec{k}_3}\rangle$, also known as the bispectrum in Fourier space. Following standard conventions, we define the dimensionless shape function S such that 

$$
\langle \zeta_{\vec{k}_1} \zeta_{\vec{k}_2} \zeta_{\vec{k}_3}\rangle' = \frac{(2\pi)^4}{(k_1 k_2 k_3)^2} \Delta_\zeta^4 \, S(k_1, k_2, k_3),
$$

where $\Delta_\zeta^2 = \frac{k^3}{2\pi^2} \langle \zeta_{\vec{k}} \zeta_{-\vec{k}}\rangle'$ is the dimensionless power spectrum of thecurvature perturbation. The main signature left by the massive field in the shape function lodges in its squeezed limit $k_3 \ll k_1 \approx k_2$. There, correlations between long and short modes become important than those arising from pure contact interactions, which dominate around the equilateral configurations. The long mode $k_3$ crosses the horizon before the short modes $k_1$ and $k_2$. The movies below display the bispectrum squeezed limit as function of time for the following interaction $\dot{\pi}_c \sigma^2$, both for $\rho/H = 0.1$ (weak mixing) and $\rho/H = 5$ (strong mixing). The cosmological collider signal probes the superhorizon decay of the massive field during the time 

$$
\Delta t = H^{-1} \log (k_1/k_3).

### Weak Mixing

For $\mu_{\rm{eff}} = 5, \rho/H = 0.1$
