# The Cosmological Collider Flow

This folder contains details on the time evolution of the Cosmological Collider signals. We are interested in the three-point correlation function of the curvature perturbatio

$$
\langle \zeta_{\vec{k}_1} \zeta_{\vec{k}_2} \zeta_{\vec{k}_3}\rangle\,,
$$

also known as the bispectrum in Fourier space. Following standard conventions, we define the dimensionless shape function S such that 

$$
\langle \zeta_{\vec{k}_1} \zeta_{\vec{k}_2} \zeta_{\vec{k}_3}\rangle' = \frac{(2\pi)^4}{(k_1 k_2 k_3)^2} \Delta_\zeta^4 \, S(k_1, k_2, k_3)\,,
$$
