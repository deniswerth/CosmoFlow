# The Cosmological Collider Flow

This folder contains details on the time evolution of the Cosmological Collider signals. We are interested in the three-point correlation function of the curvature perturbation $\langle \zeta_{\vec{k}_1} \zeta_{\vec{k}_2} \zeta_{\vec{k}_3}\rangle,$

$$
\langle \zeta_{\vec{k}_1} \zeta_{\vec{k}_2} \zeta_{\vec{k}_3}\rangle,
$$

also known as the bispectrum in Fourier space. Following standard conventions, we define the dimensionless shape function <pre xml:lang="latex">\sqrt{2}</pre>
