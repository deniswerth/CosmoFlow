# The Cosmological Collider Flow

This folder contains details on the time evolution of the Cosmological Collider signals. We are interested in the three-point correlation function of the curvature perturbation - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\langle\zeta_{k_1} \zeta_{k_2} \zeta_{k_3} \rangle" />, also known as the bispectrum in Fourier space.
